Policy revision: generation 3000-3020

Node incarnation: mechanism-lab

Expected: Protected IPv4 destinations stay denied while the ruleset is regenerated and a lab veth appears. The controlled Internet endpoint stays reachable. The probe holds at least ten attempts per second and records no allow.

Actual: 20 regenerations, interface flap, rate 86.5 attempts/s, protected destinations denied, 203.0.113.10:80 allowed, captures empty. This is the mechanism lab, not the assembled stack.
